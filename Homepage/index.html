                            <p>The photos show how the Teesta river broke its banks and submerged a huge portion of a
                                nearby village.
                                The devastating floods killed more than 30 people and destroyed the livelihoods of
                                thousands.
                                Dozens of people are still missing after being swept away.
                                The flash flood was triggered by a cloudburst, which caused the South Lhonak glacial
                                lake to burst its banks. The excess water flowed into the Teesta river downstream,
                                causing its water level to rise.
                                The situation worsened after more water was released into the river from a nearby dam.
                                The gushing water from the river wreaked havoc on the Chungthang village, which adjoins
                                its banks. Earth observation experts at the University of Leicester in the UK have now
                                released photos that show the devastating impact of the floods.
                                Of the two satellite photos, one shows the village before the floods and one captures it
                                after.
                                In the photo taken before the floods, the Chungthang village, located close to the banks
                                of the Teesta river, as well as the Teesta III dam - which is a short distance away from
                                the village - is intact. But on 4 October, the Teesta III dam collapsed due to the
                                bursting of the South Lhonak glacial lake.
                                In the photo taken 10 days after the flood, one can see the collapsed dam as well as
                                clusters of houses submerged in debris left behind by floodwaters.
                                Although the image doesn't capture the flood, it depicts the areas that were submerged,
                                revealing the extent of destruction experienced by Chungthang village.</p>

                            <p>A torrent of rain on Tuesday flooded parts of Dubai, turned streets into rivers and shut
                                down the world’s second-busiest airport for a time. The deluge of water triggered the
                                question: Was this disaster caused by the United Arab Emirates’ cloud-seeding program?

                                Officials at the country’s National Center of Meteorology have been cited as saying the
                                rain was not caused by cloud seeding. CNN has reached out to the center for comment.

                                But even if the program did fly its planes through the sky leading up to the storm, it’s
                                exceedingly unlikely the efforts would have produced more rain than was going to fall
                                naturally.

                                These understandable attempts to squeeze more moisture out of clouds have been around
                                for decades, but with little evidence of success.

                                But that hasn’t stopped some countries, including the UAE, China and the US, from trying
                                to modify the weather.

                                Here’s what to know about cloud seeding.</p>

                                A violent storm hit the northern West Bengal district of Jalpaiguri on Sunday,
                                leaving over 300 people injured and claiming the lives of at least five people.
                                The calamitous event wreaked havoc widespreada devastating, particularly affecting
                                areas such as Bakali, Barnish, Jorpakdi, Madhabdanga, Rajarhat and Saptibari.
                                West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banarjee rushed to the norther district on Sunday
                                night and
                                visited the hospital where the injured were undergoing treatment and spoke to the family
                                members of the deceased.
